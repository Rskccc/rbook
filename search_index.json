Ideally, the projects will be based on “real” tasks students have from their research or daily work. Several opitions will also be provided by the lecturers in case a group has difficulty identifying an appropriate topic.

It is very much like the ones included in Netflix and elsewhere, but free and open. The latest release of the data includes 20,000,000 individual ratings of 27,000 movies by 138,000 users. For class, we are using (most of) the much smaller, 1998 release, which includes 100,000 ratings, of 1700 movies by nearly 1000 users. The data included on the class website is modified slightly from the original. Specifically, we have: - added informative column names, which were not included in the original data files, but described in a separate readme file - removed a couple of columns, including a timestamp indicating when the rating was made - changed | delimited files to tab delimited, - removed 2 movies of unknown genre, - removed duplicate entries for a handful of movies that are included in the database twice. It should be noted that some movie names are duplicated, when two different films happen to have the same name, or when a movie is remade at a later date. Name and year together make a unique identifier in these cases. There are 4 data files in the course folder. The ratings themselves are found in ratingsData.txt, one rating per line. Users and movies are labeled by random, numerical IDs in the ratings data. A separate movieData.txt file links the numerical movieID to title, year, and genre, while the userData.txt file provides basic demographics for each user, including age, gender, occupation and 1zipcode. A fourth file ratingsDataPlus.txt combining limited information from all 3 files is provided as well for your convenience. 2.2 Data Manipulation The first step will be to read in the data. I think this is fairly straightforward, although there are non-alpha-numeric characters among the movie names, which may affect the arguments to read.table. userDat = read.table(&quot;userData.txt&quot;, header=T, row.names=1, as.is=T, sep=&quot;\\t&quot;, fill=T) movieDat = read.table(&quot;movieData.txt&quot;, header=T,row.names=1,as.is=T,sep=&quot;\\t&quot;,quote=&quot;&quot;) ratingsDat = read.table(&quot;ratingsData.txt&quot;, header=T,as.is=T,sep=&quot;\\t&quot;) 2.3 Data Visualization 2.4 Statistical Analysis 2.5 Results "],["references.html", "References", " References "]]
