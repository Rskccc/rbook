In this class, you are expected to formulate groups with your classmates, work as a group on a data analysis project using what you learn from the class (and beyond) about R, generate a analysis report, and present as a group your report in the last week. 1.2 What are the project options? Ideally, the projects will be based on real tasks you have from your research or daily work. Several options will also be suggested to you only if your group has difficulty identifying an appropriate topic. 1.3 What needs to be in the report? The report should at least include the following sections: Background Introduction of the project Goal Research question(s) the analysis aims to answer Data Description of the data Data cleaning and manipulation steps Data summary and visualization Statistical analysis Methods applied in the analysis Analysis Results Summary Report your findings 1.4 How should the report be formatted? Please use R Markdown for conducting your analysis and generating the report. You report may be included in this R for Cancer Research book! 1.5 Example In the next chapter, we provide an example of the final project. "],["movie.html", "Chapter 2 The Movie Lens Data (Example) 2.1 Background", " Chapter 2 The Movie Lens Data (Example) 2.1 Background MovieLens (http://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/) is a movie recommendation engine devel- oped and administered by a research group at the University of Minnesota. It is very much like the ones included in Netflix and elsewhere, but free and open. The latest release of the data includes 20,000,000 individual ratings of 27,000 movies by 138,000 users. For class, we are using (most of) the much smaller, 1998 release, which includes 100,000 ratings, of 1700 movies by nearly 1000 users. The data included on the class website is modified slightly from the original. Specifically, we have: added informative column names, which were not included in the original data files, but described in a separate readme file removed a couple of columns, including a timestamp indicating when the rating was made changed | delimited files to tab delimited, removed 2 movies of unknown genre, removed duplicate entries for a handful of movies that are included in the database twice. It should be noted that some movie names are duplicated, when two different films happen to have the same name, or when a movie is remade at a later date. Name and year together make a unique identifier in these cases. There are 4 data files in the course folder: The ratings themselves are found in ratingsData.txt, one rating per line. Users and movies are labeled by random, numerical IDs in the ratings data. A separate movieData.txt file links the numerical movieID to title, year, and genre. The userData.txt file provides basic demographics for each user, including age, gender, occupation and 1zipcode. A fourth file ratingsDataPlus.txt combining limited information from all 3 files is provided as well for your convenience. "],["references.html", "References", " References "]]
